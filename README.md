# Contributing to the anthology

## Please use LaTeX for writing and submitting your contribution

Please consider using [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) for writing your contribution.

If you use LaTeX, please use the current LNI (Lecture Notes in Informatics) document class which you can download from

https://www.ctan.org/pkg/lni

Please note that you find an updated, bugfixed development version of the LNI document class at 

https://github.com/gi-ev/LNI

which you may need in *rare* cases.

The LNI LaTeX document class is well-documented with current documentation at:

http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/lni/lni.pdf


If you do not wish to use LaTeX, please let us know early on and submit your contribution in an easily transferable format and submit all tables and figures as (non-bitmapped) PDF. We will then take care of transferring your contribution to LaTeX for final editing and compilation of the anthology.

## Deadline is September 30, 2022

Please submit your contribution by September 30, 2022 to give us time for compiling and finalizing the anthology in time and for having it printed as a book.

## Contribution length 

There is no length restriction in terms of pages or words, i.e., your contribution can be of any reasonable document length.

## Topic of your contribution

You may, of course, choose any topic of your liking. We were asked about the general focus of a contribution and we have always assumed some relation to your research (rather than telling stories or similar). It would be great – but is by no means necessary – if your contribution has some linkage to his research themes.
